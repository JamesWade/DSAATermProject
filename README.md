# DSAATermProject
Phone directory application using doubly-linked lists
This project can demonstrate the working of contact book applications and also 
teach you about data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. 
Typically, phone book management encompasses searching, sorting, and deleting 
operations. A distinctive feature of the search queries here is that the user sees 
suggestions from the contact list after entering each character. You can read the 
source-code of freely available projects and replicate the same to develop your 
skills.
