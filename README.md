Optimal treaps with priority-changing parameters
Treaps are a combination of BSTs and heaps. These randomized data structures 
involve assigning specific priorities to the nodes. You can go for a project that 
optimizes a set of parameters under different settings. For instance, you can set 
higher preferences for nodes that are accessed more frequently than others. Here, 
each access will set off a two-fold process:
 Choosing a random number
 Replacing the node’s priority with that number if it is found to be higher than the 
previous priority
As a result of this modification, the tree will lose its random shape. It is likely that 
the frequently-accessed nodes would now be near the tree’s root, hence delivering 
faster searches. So, experiment with this data structure and try to base your 
argument on evidence.
At the end of the project, you can either make an original discovery or even 
conclude that changing the priority of the node does not deliver much speed.
